# 2. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key, Secret Key, Region (us-west-2)

# 3. Verify connectivity
aws sts get-caller-identity
docker info
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (30-45 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate to repository
git clone https://github.com/rnaarla/medical-image-training.git
cd medical-image-training

# 2. Quick readiness check
./quick_production_check.sh

# 3. Deploy complete infrastructure
./scripts/deploy_aws.sh full

# This automatically creates:
# ‚úÖ EKS cluster with GPU nodes (p3.2xlarge, p3.8xlarge)
# ‚úÖ ECR container registry with security scanning
# ‚úÖ S3 bucket with AES-256 encryption
# ‚úÖ VPC with security groups and network isolation
# ‚úÖ IAM roles with least-privilege access
# ‚úÖ Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack
# ‚úÖ Auto-scaling groups (3-20 nodes)
```

### Phase 3: Application Deployment (15-20 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Build and deploy production container
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t medical-image-training:v2.0.0 .

# 2. Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s-production.yaml

# 3. Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n medical-training
kubectl get services -n medical-training
```

### Phase 4: Production Validation (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive validation
./scripts/validate_production.sh

# 2. Access monitoring dashboards
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80
# Open: http://localhost:3000 (admin/prom-operator)

# 3. Test API endpoints
kubectl port-forward -n medical-training svc/medical-training-api-service 8080:80
curl http://localhost:8080/health
